Sum of Digits / Digital Root 6-KYU

In this kata, you must create a digital root function.

A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has two digits, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

Solution:
def digital_root(n)   
   n < 10 ? n : digital_root(n.to_s.split(//).map(&:to_i).inject(:+))
end
